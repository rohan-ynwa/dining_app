UMass Toolkit
=============

This is the documentation for UMass Toolkit, an unofficial API wrapper library
for various APIs serving up data related to the
`University of Massachusetts Amherst <https://www.umass.edu/>`_. It also hosts
documentation for those APIs themselves, meant to aid their use in other
languages.

The UMass Toolkit is written in Python 3 and depends on
`requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_.
